# Comprehensive Java Programming Showcase

## üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the Java Development Project! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of **Java programming concepts**, all in one place. It's designed to be a valuable resource for both learning and reference, covering everything from fundamental principles to advanced topics. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps in Java or an experienced developer looking for practical examples, this repository is built to enhance your understanding and skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Concepts and Features:**
  - **OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
  - **Collection Framework:** Core interfaces like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, and their implementations (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, etc.).
  - **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files using streams and readers.
  - **Concurrency and Threads:** Creating and managing multiple threads, handling synchronization, and setting thread priorities.
  - **Exception Handling:** Using `try-catch` blocks, `throw`/`throws`, and creating custom exceptions for robust error management.
  - **Advanced Java Concepts:** Abstract classes, interfaces, method overriding, constructors, and dynamic method dispatch.

## üìö Topics Covered
This project provides hands-on examples for a wide array of Java topics.

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Core Pillars:** `BankManagement.java` and `OOPSConcepts.java` demonstrate **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction** in practical scenarios.
- **Runtime Polymorphism:** `DynamicMethodDispatch.java` showcases dynamic method dispatch.
- **Constructors and Overloading:** Examples are available in `Constructors.java`, `ConstructorsInInheritance.java`, and `MethodOverloading.java`.
- **Access Control:** `AccessModifiers.java` and `ModifiersQuestions.java` explain the use of `public`, `private`, and `protected` modifiers.

### 2. Collection Framework
- **Data Structures:** `Arraylist.java`, `Hashset.java`, `Linkedlist.java`, and `Arraydeque.java` show how to use various collection types for efficient data management, highlighting their unique characteristics.

### 3. File Handling
- **Reading and Writing Files:** Practical examples demonstrate Java's I/O system with classes like `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileWriter` for common tasks like reading a file line-by-line.

### 4. Threads and Concurrency
- **Thread Creation:** Learn to create threads using both the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface in `Threads.java` and `RunnableInterfaces.java`.
- **Concurrency Control:** Examples cover thread priorities (`ThreadPriorities.java`), synchronization, and methods like `join()` and `sleep()` to manage thread execution.

### 5. Exception Handling
- **Try-Catch Blocks:** `ExceptionClass.java` and `ErrorExceptionsPracticeSet.java` illustrate how to handle various exception types.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Learn to create and use custom exceptions with `throw` and `throws` in `CustomExceptions.java` and `ThrowVsThrows.java`.
- **Advanced Handling:** `NestedTryCatch.java` and `FinallyBlock.java` explore nested `try-catch` blocks and the `finally` keyword.

### 6. Advanced Java Concepts
- **Abstraction:** `AbstractMethodsAndClass.java` and `Interface.java` explain abstract methods, interfaces, and how Java handles scenarios requiring multiple inheritance.

### 7. Practical Problem-Solving
- **Algorithms and Recursion:** Solutions to common problems like factorial (`Factorial.java`), Fibonacci series (`FibonacciSeries.java`), and recursive sums (`SumUsingRecursion.java`).
- **Interactive Console Games:** Fun examples like `GuessTheNumber.java` and `RockPaperScissor.java` demonstrate user interaction and game logic.
- **Data Operations:** Classes like `ArraySum.java` and `FindElementInArray.java` provide examples of common array manipulations.

### 8. Additional Java Concepts
- **Date and Time API:** `DateClass.java` and `CalenderClass.java` show how to work with dates and time in Java.
- **Varargs:** `VarArgs.java` provides detailed examples of using variable arguments in methods.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11** or later.
- An IDE like **VS Code** (with the Java extension pack), Eclipse, or a simple text editor.

### Usage
1.  **Navigate to the project directory** after downloading the files.
2.  **Compile a Java file:**
    Open a terminal and use the Java compiler (`javac`) to compile the file you want to run.
    ```sh
    javac path/to/your/ClassName.java
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```sh
    javac OOPSConcepts/OOPSConcepts.java
    ```
3.  **Run the compiled Java code:**
    Use the `java` command to execute the compiled bytecode.
    ```sh
    java path.to.your.ClassName
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```sh
    java OOPSConcepts.OOPSConcepts
    ```

Happy Coding!
